# Chuuni

An anime review community that will someday be compatible with ActivityPub.

## Usage

To start Chuuni:

  * Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up` to start the dev database
  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
