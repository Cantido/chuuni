<h1 class="title">How ratings are averaged</h1>

  <p>
    Chuuni uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_average">Bayesian average</a>
    of ratings, instead of the mean rating. A Bayesian average scales the resulting average for a single anime
    closer towards the global rating average when the number of ratings is small, which allows Chuuni instances
    to have fair ratings at any user count. That way, a single user can't disrupt the average rating,
    even if they're the only person who has given a rating.
  </p>

  <h2 class="title is-4">An example</h2>

  <p>
    We will use this instance's data to show you how the top anime on this instance,
    <a href={~p"/anime/#{@top_anime.summary.anime}"}><i><%= @top_anime.summary.anime.title.english %></i></a>, received its rating of
    <%= Float.round(@top_anime.summary.rating, 2) %>
    <img src={~p"/images/bootstrap/star-fill.svg"} />,
    instead of the arithmetic mean of its ratings, which is <%= Decimal.round(@top_mean_rating.rating, 2) %>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before we can calculate the Bayesian average of ratings for <i><%= @top_anime.summary.anime.title.english %></i>, we must calculate two site-wide constants:

    <ul>
      <li>the average of all ratings on the instance, \(m\)</li>
      <li>the confidence number, \(C\)</li>
    </ul>

    The confidence number is the 25th-percentile value of the number of ratings each anime has.
    That just means if you counted all of the site's ratings for each anime,
    then put those numbers in a list, and sorted them top-to-bottom, the 25th-percentile value
    would sit 25% of the way up from the bottom of the list.
    That means that 25% of the site's anime have a rating count below this value, and the rest are above it.
  </p>

  <p>
    This instance has <%= ngettext "1 rating", "%{count} ratings", @global_rating_count %>
    total, with an average of <%= Decimal.round(@global_rating_average, 2) %>
    <img src={~p"/images/bootstrap/star-fill.svg"} alt="stars" />,
    and the rating count that sits 25% of the way up from the bottom of the anime list is
    <%=  Float.round(@rating_lower_quartile, 2) %>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The equation for the Bayesian average looks like this:
    <span>\[ bayesAvg = {animeRatingAvg * animeRatingCount + C * m \over animeRatingCount + C} \]</span>

    <i><%= @top_anime.summary.anime.title.english %></i> has
    <%= ngettext "1 rating", "%{count} ratings", @top_mean_rating.count %>, with a mean rating of <%= Decimal.round(@top_mean_rating.rating, 2) %>.
    Plugging those numbers into the equation, we get:

    <span>
      \[ bayesAvg =
      {
      <%= Decimal.round(@top_mean_rating.rating, 2) %>
      *
      <%= @top_mean_rating.count %>
      +
      <%= Float.round(@rating_lower_quartile, 2) %>
      *
      <%= Decimal.round(@global_rating_average, 2) %>
      \over
      <%= @top_mean_rating.count %>
      +
      <%= Float.round(@rating_lower_quartile, 2) %>
      } \]
    </span>

    Which gives us a final answer of...

    <span>
      \[ bayesAvg = <%= Float.round(@top_anime.summary.rating, 2) %> \]
    </span>

    If you go to the <a href={~p"/top"}>top anime page</a>, you will see that
    <i><%= @top_anime.summary.anime.title.english %></i>
    indeed has a rating of
    <%= Float.round(@top_anime.summary.rating, 2) %>
    <img src={~p"/images/bootstrap/star-fill.svg"} alt="stars" />.
